    <h3>German Shepherd</h3>
    <p>The <a href="nowhere">German Shepherd</a> or German Shepherd Dog,[2][a] also known as the Alsatian,
        [3] is a German breed of working dog of medium to large size. It is a modern
        breed, developed by Max von Stephanitz from various traditional German herding
        dogs and wolf-dogs from 1899.[4][5]

        It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been
        used in many other types of work, including disability assistance,
        search-and-rescue, police work and warfare.[6][failed verification]
        It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the Fédération
        Cynologique Internationale has the second-highest number of annual
        registrations.[7]
